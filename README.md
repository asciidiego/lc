Repository for deliberate practice. It is inspired by Peter Norvig repository on
Python _Ã©tudes_: [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/).

## Foreword

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a site that I use to practice programming.
I do not know if it is the most efficient way of doing it---or if it is
efficient at all. But I do know that practice makes perfect, so, as long as you
are practicing, I think I am on a good-enough path. After all, practice is
already 80% of the work. At least at first.

Many times, while we want to learn something new, novices fall for a typical
mistake: focusing too much on how to do it perfectly instead of jumping at the
pool and learning on the get go. This is normal at first, but you should try to
fight this impulse. The phenomenon is so common that computer scientists have a
name for it: premature optimization. Some of them also say that premature
optimization is the root of all evil[^1].

In the end, what matters is that you practice. You can worry about optimization
later: when you have developed the habit of deliberate practice and deep work.
